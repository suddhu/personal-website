    Sudharshan Suresh (he/him) is a final-year PhD candidate in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Michael Kaess. He is also a part-time researcher at FAIR, working with the Embodied AI team. His research focus is on spatial AI for robot manipulation. Specifically, he is interested in object-centric methods that combine vision and touch for interactive perception. The research fuses ideas from SLAM with data-driven perception across dexterous manipulation, planar pushing, and nonprehensile sliding tasks. Prior to this, he completed his Masters in Robotics at CMU, working on underwater SLAM and active exploration. His work in manipulation, perception, and SLAM has been presented at CoRL, ICRA, IROS, and RA-L. Sudharshan is the recipient of the Hima and Jive Fellowship in Computer Science and the best paper finalist in service robotics at ICRA 2021.
